        Crystal and the Chicken
    <span class="normaltext" style="display:block;"> 
        This is the story of Crystal and a chicken tender. 
        One day my dad let Crystal sniff a chicken tender<span style="font-size: 10px">(of course he didn't know what was coming)</span>
        As Crystal sniffed the chicken tender she was so shocked that she fell backwards. 
        In slow motion we watched as poor Crystal fell over the cat tree and plummeted toward the ground. 
        Once she hit the ground she started to lick herself in embarrasment, and she walked off with no scratches or injuries other than a burned ego.

        Diamond and the Piano
    <span class="normaltext" style="display:block;"> 
      This story begins after me and my family have left the house. 
      We were exploring home depot until we got a notification that someone had broken into our house. 
      Horrified we checked the cameras but found no one in the house, except the sound of Diamond yowling and meowing. 
      We hurried home and found Diamond on the piano the lid shut, we thought he was fine until we realised Diamond was pinned down.
      His paw trapped under the Piano. My mom quickly saved Diamonds paw and we rushed him to the vet when we found he was limping. 
      We waited a long time because the vet had a lot of patients luckily Diamond only had a bruised paw and we gave him some medication and never left the piano lid up again.
